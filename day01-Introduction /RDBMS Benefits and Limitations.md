RDBMS Benefits and Limitations

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) offer several benefits, including robust data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance,
powerful querying capabilities with SQL, and strong support for data relationships via foreign keys and joins. They are highly scalable vertically and can handle complex transactions reliably.
However, RDBMS also have limitations such as difficulties in horizontal scaling, which can limit performance in highly distributed systems. They can be less flexible with schema changes, often requiring significant 
effort to modify existing structures, and may not be the best fit for unstructured data or large-scale, high-velocity data environments typical of some NoSQL solutions.
