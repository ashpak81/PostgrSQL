PostgreSQL vs NoSQL
PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database system, excels in handling complex queries, ensuring data integrity, and supporting ACID transactions, making it ideal for applications 
requiring intricate data relationships and strong consistency. It offers advanced features like JSON support for semi-structured data, full-text search, and extensive indexing capabilities.
In contrast, NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB or Cassandra, prioritize scalability and flexibility, often supporting schema-less designs that make them suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data
and high-velocity workloads. These databases are typically used in scenarios requiring rapid development, horizontal scaling, and high availability, often at the cost of reduced consistency guarantees compared to PostgreSQL.

Data model differences: MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL
MongoDB and PostgreSQL are different types of databases that have distinct data models.

MongoDB
MongoDB is a document database that stores data as key-value pairs in JSON documents. Each document can hold various types of data, including arrays, Booleans, numbers, strings, and nested documents. By using Binary JSON (BSON), MongoDB holds additional data types and processes data efficiently. With the data storage flexibility in MongoDB, you can store unstructured, evolving, and dynamic data.

MongoDB organizes each document into collections, with each having a unique ObjectId, which you use to identify a document. The following table shows an example of customer data in MongoDB.

customers:[

{

  customer_id: "1",

  name: “John Doe”,

  country: "United States"

},

{

  customer_id: "2",

  age: “35”

  email: "jane_doe@example.com"

}]

PostgreSQL
In contrast, PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that combines object-oriented features with relational database capabilities. In a table, every row represents individual data points, and each column defines the type of information that you store there. PostgreSQL supports a range of data types, including dates, text, integers, and Booleans. 

Unlike MongoDB, PostgreSQL uses a predefined schema to store data. A schema allows for strong data consistency and integrity, as each column holds a specific data type. However, it’s less flexible. We share an example in the following table.

dbo.customers

customer_id       name       age             email

1               John Doe      24       john_doe@example.com

2              Jane Doe       35        jane_doe@example.com
