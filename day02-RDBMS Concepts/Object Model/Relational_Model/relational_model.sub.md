Domains in PostgreSQL

Domains in PostgreSQL are essentially user-defined data types that can be created using the CREATE DOMAIN command. These custom data types allow you to apply constraints and validation rules to columns in your tables by defining a set of values that are valid for a particular attribute or field. This ensures consistency and data integrity within your relational database.
To create a custom domain, you need to define a name for your domain, specify its underlying data type, and set any constraints or default values you want to apply. Domains in PostgreSQL are a great way to enforce data integrity and consistency in your relational database. They allow you to create custom data types based on existing data types with added constraints, default values, and validation rules. By using domains, you can streamline your database schema and ensure that your data complies with your business rules or requirements.

Attributes in the Relational Model
Attributes in the relational model are the columns of a table, representing the properties or characteristics of the entity described by the table. Each attribute has a domain, defining the possible values it can take, such as integer, text, or date. Attributes play a crucial role in defining the schema of a relation (table) and are used to store and manipulate data. They are fundamental in maintaining data integrity, enforcing constraints, and enabling the relational operations that form the basis of SQL queries.

Tuples
In the relational model, a tuple is a fundamental concept that represents a single record or row in a table. In PostgreSQL, a tuple is composed of a set of attribute values, each corresponding to a specific column or field in the table. A tuple is defined as an ordered set of attribute values, meaning that each value in a tuple corresponds to a specific attribute or column in the table. The values can be of different data types, such as integers, strings, or dates, depending on the schema of the table.
For example, consider a users table with columns id, name, and email. A sample tuple in this table could be (1, 'John Smith', 'john.smith@example.com'), where each value corresponds to its respective column. PostgreSQL provides a variety of operations that can be performed on tuples.

Relations in the Relational Model
In the relational model, a relation is essentially a table composed of rows and columns, where each row represents a unique record (or tuple) and each column represents an attribute of the data. The structure of a relation is defined by its schema, which specifies the relationâ€™s name and the names and data types of its attributes. Relations are governed by integrity constraints, such as domain constraints, key constraints, and referential integrity constraints, to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Operations like selection, projection, join, and others can be performed on relations to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.

Constraints in PostgreSQL
Constraints are an essential part of the relational model, as they define rules that the data within the database must follow. They ensure that the data is consistent, accurate, and reliable.

Primary Key - A primary key constraint is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. There can only be one primary key per table, and its value must be unique and non-null for each row.

Foreign Key - A foreign key constraint ensures that a column or columns in a table refer to an existing row in another table. It helps maintain referential integrity between tables.

Unique - A unique constraint ensures that the values in a column or set of columns are unique across all rows in a table. In other words, it prevents duplicate entries in the specified column(s).

Check - A check constraint verifies that the values entered into a column meet a specific condition. It helps to maintain data integrity by restricting the values that can be inserted into a column.

Not Null - A NOT NULL constraint enforces that a column cannot contain a NULL value. This ensures that a value must be provided for the specified column when inserting or updating data in the table.

Exclusion - An exclusion constraint is a more advanced form of constraint that allows you to specify conditions that should not exist when comparing multiple rows in a table. It helps maintain data integrity by preventing conflicts in data.


The Relational Model: Null Values
In the relational model used by PostgreSQL, null values represent missing or unknown information within a database. Unlike zero, empty strings, or other default values, null signifies the absence of a value and is treated uniquely in operations and queries. For example, any arithmetic operation involving a null results in a null, and comparisons with null using standard operators return unknown rather than true or false. To handle null values, PostgreSQL provides specific functions and constructs such as IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, and the COALESCE function, which returns the first non-null value in its arguments. Understanding and correctly handling null values is crucial for accurate data retrieval and integrity in relational databases.
