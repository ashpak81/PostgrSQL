Transactions
Transactions are a fundamental concept in database management systems, allowing multiple statements to be executed within a single transaction context. In PostgreSQL, transactions provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, which ensure that your data remains in a consistent state even during concurrent access or system crashes. By leveraging transaction control, savepoints, concurrency control, and locking, you can build robust and reliable applications that work seamlessly with PostgreSQL.
